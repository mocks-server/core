### BREAKING CHANGES
- feat: Renamed configuration file from `mocks-server.config.js` to `mocks.config.js`

- feat: Remove deprecated option `feature`, `behavior` option should be used instead
- feat: Legacy mocks defined using v1 format have to be loaded from folder defined using option `pathLegacy` instead of `path`, which now is used to define the folder from which load routes and mocks in v2 format. Folder defined with `pathLegacy` option will not be created automatically if it is not found, and the option is not required
- feat: Watching files for mocks in legacy v1 format has to be disabled using `watchLegacy` option instead of `watch`, which now affects only to routes and mocks in v2 format
